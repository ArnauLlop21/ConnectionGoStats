# ConnectionGoStats
A Go repository to explore the different connection capacities of golang.

# Why?
My intention when starting this repository is to start learning a new programming language. GoLang is as interesting as it gets for someone like me, so, my idea is to once in a while develop some small project in Go to get familiarized to GoLang!
